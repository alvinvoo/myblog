It's OK for one to be succinct and precise in saying what one has to say.  
Traditional education has taught us to 'fill in the blanks' or 'write a 1000 words essay' in which we had to conjure up extra words to get those few extra points.  
This creates a habit out of us where we had to make up 'fillers' in real life. Our mind has been conditioned to think that we _need to_ have more to offer than what we actually have.  
In fact, we **DO NOT NEED TO** puff ourselves up, and make up words where there's none.  
Just be straight to the point.
